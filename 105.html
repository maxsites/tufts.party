<h1>COMP 105 Assignment: uParty</h1>
<p>Due <B>Thursday</B>, December 15, at 10:00PM.<br></p>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to help you get acquainted with your
fellow classmates after a strugglebus of a semester. The assignment is divided
into two parts.</p>

<ul>
    <li>In the first part, you may submit a request for some non-negative
        number of modules for use in this assignment. Most find this helpful,
        but for some it is unnecessary.</li>
    <li>In the second part, you implement <em>uParty</em> at the specified
        location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Individual Problems</h2>

<p><i>Working on your own</i>, please solve <em>Exercise M</em>.</p>

<h3>Problem Details</h3>

<p>If you would prefer not to request a module, please skip this problem.</p>

<p><b>Exercise M.</b> Request a module for use in <em>uParty</em>. The script
to request modules for this assignment is in
<code>/h/mberns01/request-modules</code>. You will need to provide the request
script with your Venmo username and number of desired modules. If you do not
have a Venmo account, you must either create one or bring cash. A sample
interaction with the script looks as follows:</p>
<pre>
     $ /h/mberns01/request-modules
     What is your Venmo username? A-Sad-Student
     The cost per module is $X.
     How many modules would you like to request? 5
     Thank you and have a nice day!
</pre>

<p>For students without a Venmo account, the interaction should look as
follows:</p>
<pre>
     $ /h/mberns01/request-modules
     What is your Venmo username? NONE
     The cost per module is $X+1.
     How many modules would you like to request? 5
     Thank you, please bring cash, and have a nice day!
</pre>

<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
    <p><li>Option <code>NONE</code> is special in its capitalization.</li></p>
    <p><li>Failing to pay for your module <em>soon after you are charged</em>
        results in exception <code>BringYourOwn</code> being raised.</li><p>
    <p><li>All requests must go through the module request script. No
        exceptions.</li></p>
</ul>


<h2>Group Problems</h2>

<p>For these problems, you are encouraged to work with a partner or a group.</p>

<h3>Problem Details</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to de-stress after the final exam of a difficult course,
ideally with other students who just finished the same course. In this portion
of the homework, you will implement <em>uParty</em> in several stages.</p>

<p><b>Exercise 1.</b> <i>Get <code>letrec</code>'d.</i>
How else will you modify your environment?
</p>

<p><b>Exercise 2.</b> <i><code>(timesRepeat: 105 {(dance)})</code>.</i></b>
What is a good uParty implementation without some dancing? Get out there, go
crazy.
</p>

<p><i>uParty</i> follows the following operational semantics:</p>

<img src="opsem.png" />

<p><b>Currently, <i>environment</i> is undefined. If you would like to help
    define it, please contact Max Bernstein or Maretta Morovitz on
    Facebook.</b></p>

<p>Additionally, if you can prove the identities<br />
<pre>
      (= (type-of (cons a-cs-student a-cs-party)) (type-of a-cs-party))

  and

      (&gt; (lit-ness (cons a-cs-student a-cs-party)) (lit-ness a-cs-party))

  forAll (a-cs-student, a-cs-party)
</pre>
then you can use them in your assignment.

<h4>Extra-credit Problems</h4>

<p><b>Invite Jared Chandler.</b>
Any student able to convince Jared to complete this assignment will receive a
grade of Excellent.</p>

<p><b>Break interface boundaries with a TA.</b>
Breaking interface boundaries, while normally discouraged, is encouraged
for the duration of this assignment.</p>

<h3>What to submit: Individual Problems</h3>

<p>You should submit one item:
<ul><li>A module request (optional)</li></ul></p>

<h3>What to submit: Group Problems</h3>

<p>You should submit one item:
<ul><li>Yourself, to the party</li></ul></p>

<h3>Hints and Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
    <p><li>Submit your module request <em>early</em>. Module requests made
        closer to the party are less likely to get fulfilled.</li></p>
    <p><li>For your reference, this <a
     href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464907/">critically-acclaimed</a>
        documentary about partying and social interaction discusses relevant
        topics at length. It should be free online via questionable means. You
        may also find the <a
     href="http://www.bestdegreeprograms.org/geeks-guide-partying/">geek's
     guide to college parties</a> infographic helpful.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Avoid Smalltalk.</b>
        The goal of this assignment is to have a good time, not to awkwardly stand
        around chatting. Do not talk about the weather or how poorly the exam
        went!</li></p>
    <p><li>We do not provide any invariants or guarantees as to behavior
        following the termination of the party environment.</li></p>
    <p><li>uParty <i>may not</i> implement garbage collection, so please be
        efficient with your use of modules.</li></p>
    <p><li>Norman Ramsey's implementation of this assignment takes two modules
        and has been lit since 1990.</li></p>
</ul>
